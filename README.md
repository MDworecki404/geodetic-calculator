Vincenty's formulae are two related iterative methods used in geodesy to calculate the distance between two points on the surface of a spheroid, developed by Thaddeus Vincenty (1975a). 
They are based on the assumption that the figure of the Earth is an oblate spheroid, and hence are more accurate than methods that assume a spherical Earth, such as great-circle distance.

The first (direct) method computes the location of a point that is a given distance and azimuth (direction) from another point. 
The second (inverse) method computes the geographical distance and azimuth between two given points. 
They have been widely used in geodesy because they are accurate to within 0.5 mm (0.020 in) on the Earth ellipsoid.
